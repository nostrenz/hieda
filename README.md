# Hieda

Local anime and manga database.

This is actually something I made a long _loooong_ time ago beacause I wanted to manually organize my collection into a local database and existing anime management programs weren't really what I was looking for. I neved released it publicly for some reasons. It works but keep in mind that it's not a recent project by any means.
